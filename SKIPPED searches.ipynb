    "Skipped Searches in Splunk – Advanced SHC SOP (With Captain / Member / Deployer Roles)\n",
    "\n",
    "This SOP provides a complete troubleshooting and RCA workflow for Skipped Searches in a Splunk Search Head Cluster (SHC). \n",
    "It includes exact responsibilities for Captain, Members, and Deployer.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Overview\n",
    "Skipped searches occur when Splunk intentionally does not execute scheduled searches due to resource, concurrency, or configuration limitations. \n",
    "This impacts correlation searches, dashboards, and ES notables.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Symptoms\n",
    "• Correlation searches not generating notables\n",
    "• Dashboard panels not updating\n",
    "• ES Health Dashboard shows skipped searches\n",
    "• scheduler.log contains: “Search skipped due to exceeded concurrency limit”\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Root Causes\n",
    "• Search concurrency exceeded (max_searches_per_cpu)\n",
    "• CPU / Memory / I/O exhaustion\n",
    "• Long-running hung searches\n",
    "• Too many Data Model Acceleration jobs\n",
    "• ES correlation searches heavily overlapping\n",
    "• SHC Captain overloaded\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "4. SHC Role Responsibility Matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "Captain:\n",
    "• Runs scheduler\n",
    "• Executes scheduled searches\n",
    "• Runs correlation searches\n",
    "• Manages DMA\n",
    "\n",
    "Members:\n",
    "• Execute delegated jobs\n",
    "• Handle ad‑hoc searches\n",
    "• Maintain KVstore replication\n",
    "\n",
    "Deployer:\n",
    "• Pushes configuration (savedsearches.conf, limits.conf, datamodels.conf)\n",
    "• Central config authority for SHC\n",

    "\n",
    "Step 1 — Validate System Load (Captain)\n",
    "• Check CPU, Memory, I/O\n",
    "• If load > 80%, expect skipped searches\n",

    "\n",
    "Step 3 — Kill Hung Searches (Any Member)\n",
    "splunk cancel <sid>\n",
    "splunk dispatch-clean --all\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 4 — Tune ES Correlation Searches (Deployer)\n",
    "• Disable unused ES searches\n",
    "• Increase cron windows\n",
    "• Stagger timings\n",
    "\n",
    "File:\n",
    "savedsearches.conf\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 5 — Fix Data Model Acceleration (Deployer)\n",
    "Disable unused DMAs:\n",
    "datamodels.conf\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 6 — SHC Captain Load Fix\n",
    "• Validate captain performance\n",
    "• Consider captain re-election:\n",
    "splunk bootstrap shcluster-captain\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Permanent Fixes\n",
    "• Increase CPU on Captain\n",
    "• Add more SHC members\n",
